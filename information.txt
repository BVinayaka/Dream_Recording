# EEG Dream & Emotion Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
The **EEG Dream & Emotion Analysis Dashboard** is an interactive web application that allows users to analyze their brain activity (EEG) to predict emotions, sleep stages, and dream patterns. The dashboard also generates **dream-inspired images, audio, music, and AR/VR metadata**. All user information and EEG results are securely stored in **MongoDB** in encrypted form to protect privacy.

This project combines **neuroscience, machine learning, and AI-driven creative outputs** to provide insights into subconscious patterns, emotional states, and sleep behavior.

## What Does This Project Do?

1. **User Information Collection**
   - Users provide basic personal and medical information:
     - Full Name
     - Age
     - Gender
   - This data is **encrypted** using AES before being stored in MongoDB.
   - Ensures privacy while associating EEG analysis with user profiles.

2. **EEG File Upload**
   - Users upload EEG recordings in **EDF format** (common EEG data format).
   - The system reads and preprocesses EEG signals for analysis.

3. **Emotion Detection**
   - Uses a **pre-trained LSTM neural network** to predict emotional states based on EEG signals:
     - Happy 😊
     - Fear 😨
     - Neutral 😐
   - Displays:
     - Predicted emotion
     - Probability for each emotion
     - Text description explaining the detected emotional state
   - Visualized using **bar charts** and **tables**.

4. **Sleep Stage Prediction**
   - Uses EEG features to classify **sleep stages**:
     - Awake
     - N1, N2, N3 (Non-REM stages)
     - REM
   - Visualized as:
     - Line chart showing sleep stage transitions over time
     - Probability bar chart for the most recent epoch
   - Powered by a **Random Forest classifier** trained on EEG epochs.

5. **Dream Decoding**
   - Extracts **EEG-based dream features**:
     - Mean signal
     - Standard deviation
     - Bandpower in key frequency ranges
   - Generates:
     - **Dream text description** summarizing subconscious activity
     - **Dream-inspired image** based on EEG features
     - **Dream audio waveform** derived from EEG dynamics

6. **Dream Music & AR/VR**
   - Generates a **music array** inspired by dream EEG features.
   - Produces **AR/VR metadata** including links to:
     - Dream image
     - Dream audio
     - Dream music
   - Metadata stored as a JSON file for integration with creative applications.

7. **EEG Statistics & Visualization**
   - Channel-wise statistics: mean, standard deviation, min, max
   - **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** visualization
   - **Correlation heatmap** for EEG features
   - Helps understand the overall EEG patterns and relationships.

3. **Sleep Stages**
   - Line chart showing sleep stages over time
   - Stage probabilities

4. **Dream Decoding**
   - Dream text
   - Dream image
   - Dream audio waveform

5. **Music & AR/VR**
   - AR/VR metadata in JSON format

6. **EEG Stats**
   - Channel statistics (mean, std, min, max)
   - PSD plots
   - Feature correlation heatmap

## How It Works

1. **Preprocessing**
   - EEG signals are read from EDF files using the `MNE` library.
   - Signals are normalized and prepared for feature extraction.

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Extracts features such as:
     - Power in different EEG frequency bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma)
     - Signal statistics (mean, std)
     - Signal complexity measures
   - Features are used for **sleep stage prediction** and **dream decoding**.

3. **Machine Learning Models**
   - **Emotion Detection:** LSTM neural network
   - **Sleep Stage Classification:** Random Forest classifier
   - Features are scaled using `MinMaxScaler` before predictions.

4. **Dream Simulation**
   - EEG features are converted into:
     - Textual description
     - Visual patterns (images)
     - Audio waveforms
     - Music sequences
   - Provides a creative representation of the subconscious state.

5. **Data Storage**
   - All results are stored in **MongoDB**:
     - User information is AES-encrypted
     - EEG analysis results (emotions, sleep stages, dream features)
   - Enables secure storage and retrieval for further analysis.
